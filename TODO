- preprocessor defines that aren't set but perhaps should be:
  IN_IRDC
  IN_EXPERIMENTAL
  IN_MULTICAST
  BUILD_CONTRIB
  BUILTIN_MODULES
  NO_BAN_COOKIE
- add people to trunk/AUTHORS
- consider authoring trunk/INSTALL; it is automatically added by automake but
  if there are specific instructions that a user should know about, then we
  should have an INSTALL file of our own
- consider converting from libdl to libltdl
